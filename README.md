# containerized-rabbitmq-tutorials
This repository contains the code from the official [RabbitMQ tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/) in a containerized format. 

The objective is to provide a simplified way to simulate the communication among multiple microservices, written in different
programming languages.

Available programming languages (feel free to contribute with others):
- Go
- Javascript
- PHP
- Python

Instructions to build and run the containers are available at the README file inside each folder.
